# Reflection on Dependency Injection & IoC

1. **Why it matters**
    - DI ensures low coupling, high cohesion.
    - Makes large systems maintainable and testable.
    - Without DI, scaling microservices would become unmanageable.

2. **Architect’s View**
    - Prefer constructor injection → guarantees required dependencies.
    - Use interfaces → implementations can change without code impact.
    - Always think of “Replaceability”: can I swap this implementation easily?

3. **Patterns**
    - Strategy Pattern + DI = powerful. (Ex: different payment gateways)
    - Factory + DI = flexible creation with Spring’s container managing lifecycle.

4. **Anti-patterns**
    - Field injection: limits testability
    - Too many beans of same type without qualifiers: confusing
    - Circular dependencies: sign of flawed design

5. **Future Consideration**
    - In microservices, DI ensures each service remains independent.
    - DI + Cloud Config = dynamic injection based on environment.
    - In event-driven architectures (Kafka), inject producers/consumers cleanly.

👉 If I master DI at this depth, I can reason about *why* it exists, not just *how* to use it.
